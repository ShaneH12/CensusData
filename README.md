# CensusData
Discovery / Requirements
  - Obtained data from https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2017/demo/popest/counties-detail.html. I chose the state of Louisiana's population breakdown by county.
  
Collection Phase
  - Downloaded CSV from https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2017/demo/popest/counties-detail.html.
  
Data Prep / Cleaning
  - Changed headings in excel file to more reasonably length titles
  
Exploration/Planning
  - No missing data 
  
Modeling/Algorithms
  - Used the JavaScript library D3.js to upload a CSV file and then created a bar graph out of the data. The graphs shows the population of each county in Louisiana.
  
Automation / Computation
  - Analyzed the data from the CSV file and used D3.js functions to create a bar graph that shows the population numbers for each county in Louisiana.
  
Review
  - All data imported onton bar graph correctly. There is a slight issue with the percentages along the y-axis that may cause some issues when trying to interpret the graph.
